## Introduction
> The project is intended as demonstration and should be used in production. The project is not yet complete and is still under development.

This project is a simple responsive landing page for a streaming platform like [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com).

**Important**
The design is from [Mike Cheshire](https://codepen.io/mixchex/pen/BjJxpR) recoded and implemented by myself.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
